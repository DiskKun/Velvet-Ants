2	4	16	text	Filan Diplomat	"Don't underestimate the Valarian intelligence network mr Detective. We've heard about your exploits in the surrounding regions. About your ""magical"" deductive abilities, and about your astounding success rate."	23			
2	4	17	text	Filan Diplomat	"Well of course! Who wouldn't want a detective that has solved every case he has taken, to solve the murder of our Princess."	21			
2	4	18	text	Filan Diplomat	"I was in the banquet hall, alongside most of the guests. If you are interested in which part of the banquet hall exactly, I was sat in the eastern side where most of the Valarains also sat."	21			
2	4	19	text	Filan Diplomat	"Not much I'm afraid, it was all quite sudden. All the candles were blown out, and by the time light was restored, the princess's corpse was splayed out in the center of the hall"	21			
2	4	20	text	Filan Diplomat	"The spellcasters amongst us were quickly held suspect, afterall only magic would be capable of blowing out so many candles at once, and quickly restoring them. They are all being held in the library, and have not been allowed to leave since the incident. And of course the Curians, they have plenty of reason to want one of us dead."	21

2	5	27	text	Bavro King	Detective.	34			
2	5	28	text	Bavro King	"My name is Bavro, I am the father of the deceased, and current ruler of Valaria"	35			
2	5	29	text	Bavro King	"In this hall, as was everyone else. Though my daughter had been missing from the hall for some time before the incident."	33			
2	5	30	text	Bavro King	"I'm King, Detective. I'm surrounded by enemies, as far as I'm concerned everyone present here is a suspect, even my closest aides. Everyone besides you I'd say."	37			
2	5	31	text	Bavro King	"Advice? Don't rule out anyone. Curians may appear nice and well kept, but they can be as venemous as any viper. Valarians are even worse, if an opportunity for power presents itself, most don't think twice before pouncing. "	38			
2	5	32	text	Bavro King	"I cannot give you the name of a singular person, as I mentioned before I am surrounded by enemies. But I'd be wary of our diplomat, she has made her career through knowing more than those around her. I'd bet our entire treasury she knows more than she is letting on."	33

2	6	40	text	Antoine Prince	"Ahh! Sorry, you startled me... Oh, you must be the detective. My name is Antoine, I am the first prince of the Curian Dynasty."	48			
2	6	41	text	Antoine Prince	I guess you could say I feel guilty. I was the last one to see Princess Alexandria before she passed. I should be helping but I can't seem to remember I single thing of what took place.	49			
2	6	42	text	Antoine Prince	"I speak the truth. I have no recollection of the events of the banquet. I remember waking up that morning, prepping for the event and nothing else, my earliest memory after that is being woken up by a guard who was looking for me, after the murder had already taken place."	50			
2	7	43	text	Antoine Prince	"Alexandria? Yes, we had met a couple of times. She was lovely, never treated me like an enemy even though our nations are at war. We dined, talked and laughed together in many occasions, always treating me like a great friend. Even if I wished we were more..."	51			
2	7	44	text	Antoine Prince	"UHH, NOTHING!!"	46			
2	7	45	text	Antoine Prince	"Nothing in particular. From the little I remember, all the prepping was going smoothly. I remember talking to my parents, my uncle and Filan the diplomat. After that it is all a blur. "	46

2	0	54	evidence answer	character 0	"yes, I recognize that"				
2	0	101	text	 Curian Dagger	A bloody ornate dagger crafted following curian design patterns. It’s design seems too beautiful and delicate to be carried by a common thug.				
2	0	102	text	Torn Fabric	"A torn piece of red fabric, looks like it belonged to a piece of clothing"				
2	0	103	text	Mostly Empty Flask	A mostly empty flask that contains the last drops of an unknown blue liquid.				
2	0	104	text	Comb	A beautifully crafted Ivory comb adorned with jewels. Looks like it is worth a fortune. 				
2	0	201	text	Antoine Prince	"Oh yes, I know what that is. That is my dagger, I carry it with me at all times. I was quite startled since when I woke up I no longer had it on my person. You said it was bloody? Well i can assure you I have no recollection of using it on anyone!"	0			
2	0	202	text	Filan Diplomat	"Hmm, it seems to be a piece of Valarian fabric. Based on the familiar patterns I would say that it comes from a dress, it is certainly similar to my own."	0			
2	0	203	text	Bavro King	"Although I’m not familiar with the flask or the liquid within it, I would guess it is a potion. I have seen concoctions of a similar color before. "	0			
2	0	204	text	Filan Diplomat	"Yes, I know what that is, that is the Princess’ comb, it was a gift from her mother that she received on her 16th birthday."	0
